# nato
*nato* is a C program for translating text to and from the [NATO phonetic alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet)
in linear time without a map. *nato* does not transform non-alphabetic characters and can be used safely with mixed text.

# Usage
`./nato <-to | -from> TEXT`
